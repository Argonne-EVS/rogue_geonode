Working with History
=====================
GeoGit is a specialized database that was designed for distributed editing and supports collaborative editing of geospatial data.  It is designed for vector data (point, line, polygon, etc.).
When a layer has been stored in GeoGit, it maintains the history of all of the changes made to the data along with who made the changes and when.
Within the web map, you can view the history for a layer and for the features.
