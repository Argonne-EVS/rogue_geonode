msgid "Merge is used to pull in changes from one branch to another within the same repository.  A branch is a different version of the data in the same repository.  Branches can be set up within GeoServer by someone with admin privileges. Merge can be used for branches in the same repository.  In order to merge two branches, the layers need to be added to the map.  The following will describe a scenario of merging master with a branch."

msgid "The screenshot below shows two layers.  One is multipolygon_test and the other is multipolygon_test_branch1.  The first layer is on the master branch and the second layer is on branch1. The second layer could have any name but it's labeled this way to clearly distinguish which on is the branch. Note that the upper polygon in multipolygon_test_branch1 has been updated so that it's larger.  We want to bring that edit into master (multipolygon_test)."
